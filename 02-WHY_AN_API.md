Which API do You Need?
----------------------

If you need to make connections between applications automatically, then you
need the **SAMv3 API**.

If you need to monitor or adjust the I2P router's connection, bandwidth usage,
or change it's status, then you need the **I2PControl API**.

If you need to simply check the presence of an I2P router before making
connections, one way is to make a quick connection to the **I2CP API**.
