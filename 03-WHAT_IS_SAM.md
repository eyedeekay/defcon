What is SAM
-----------

SAM is a simple API for controlling **connections** on the I2P i2p router in a
way which is familiar to people who write internet applications. To use it, you
simply set up a SAM connection and then use it like a streaming connection or
to send datagrams, either with or without a repliable address. You can use these
connections just like their TCP/IP equivalents for basically every intent or
purpose.
