Two big things that SAM can't do and how to easily forget about them
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Tell you that an I2P router is running when SAM is not enabled

To do this effectively, you need to check for the existence of an I2CP port, but
you don't need to actually use I2CP for anything else.

### Adjust the I2P Router's settings

To do this, you need to use i2pcontrol.
