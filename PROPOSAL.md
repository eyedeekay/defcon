Abstract
--------

The workshop provides an introduction to the ways an application can be made to
work with the I2P Anonymous Peer-to-Peer network. Developers should learn that
the use of anonymous P2P in their applications need not be that different than
what they are already doing in non-anonymous Peer-to-Peer applications. It
begins with an introduction to the I2P plugins system, showing how the existing
plugins set themselves up to do communication over i2p and what's good and bad
about each approach. Afterwards, we'll continue on to the programattically
controlling I2P via its SAM and I2PControl API's. Finally, we'll take a dive
into the SAMv3 API by starting a new library utilizing it in Lua and writing
a simple application.

We(The I2P Project) would also like to request a table for 4 in the main room
for the duration of the conference so that we can hang a banner and have
meetings with other users and organizations about incorporating I2P into their
projects. *We would like this table even if the workshop proposal is rejected.*
*Whitney advised us that this was the place to apply for table space.*

Intended Audience
-----------------

Developers of new and existing applications that make use of networked
communications that may benefit from enhanced privacy.

Presenter Biographics
---------------------

idk writes I2P applications and libraries and likes to point out all the cool
things you actually can do with anonymous networks. He originated one SAM
library and maintains two others, and tries to participate in pretty much all
of them. idk also likes to make sure I2P noobs get the help they need on Reddit
and blogs about I2P application development.

I2P is a 17-year-old Open-Source project dedicated to enabling privacy and
anonymity using advanced cryptography. It enables client-server applications,
hidden services, and peer-to-peer applications to work anonymously and provides
API's orientated toward application development in addition to browsing.

Materials provided
------------------

Each participant will be provided with a detailed handout which will provide
a schedule of the workshop with references to additional resources relevant to
each section. The full source code of the Lua library that will be developed
will be publshed prior to Def Con to be used as a resource during the workshop.
Practical activities will be distributed during the workshop to the participants
to demonstrate the techniques that will be illustrated.

Audio/Visual/Computer Requirements
----------------------------------

Participants are welcome, but not required, to follow along with the examples
and practicum provided during the workshop. In order to do so, they will need
a laptop with internet access and their choice of Lua interpreter installed.
They should also have I2P routers installed, either I2P or i2pd will do, but if
they do not wish to install a router, I will bring a machine which will expose
the API's they need for testing purposes they can use while they are here. I
will also need a way to display examples to the workshop participants, either a
projector or a large television would be best.
