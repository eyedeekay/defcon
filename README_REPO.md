Using the contents of this repository
=====================================

In the spirit of de-centralization, this repository is intended to be able to
produce plain-text resources, web resources for both the I2P blog and for
standalone, static sites, and as PDF which can be printed and optionally, bound.
To make changes to it, ONLY edit the markdown files, everything else is
generated from them.

I like to word-process on hard mode.
