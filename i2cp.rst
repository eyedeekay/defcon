`I2CP <https://geti2p.net/en/docs/protocol/i2cp>`__
---------------------------------------------------

I2CP is the core I2P API, it underlies many of the other I2P API's. It is also
the most complex to use outside of Java, but recently several libraries have
emerged that provide partial or full I2CP functionality from other languages.
C, Java, and Javascript libraries are available, as is one Go library with
partial support.
