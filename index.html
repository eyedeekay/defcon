<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The workshop provides an introduction to the ways an application can be made to work with the I2P Anonymous Peer-to-Peer network. Developers should learn that the use of anonymous P2P in their applications need not be that different than what they are already doing in non-anonymous Peer-to-Peer applications. It begins with an introduction to the I2P plugins system, showing how the existing plugins set themselves up to do communication over i2p and what's good and bad about each approach. Afterwards, we'll continue on to the programattically controlling I2P via its SAM and I2PControl API's. Finally, we'll take a dive into the SAMv3 API by starting a new library utilizing it in Lua and writing a simple application.</p>
<p>We(The I2P Project) would also like to request a table for 4 in the main room for the duration of the conference so that we can hang a banner and have meetings with other users and organizations about incorporating I2P into their projects. <em>We would like this table even if the workshop proposal is rejected.</em> <em>Whitney advised us that this was the place to apply for table space.</em></p>
<h2 id="intended-audience">Intended Audience</h2>
<p>Developers of new and existing applications that make use of networked communications that may benefit from enhanced privacy.</p>
<h2 id="presenter-biographics">Presenter Biographics</h2>
<p>idk writes I2P applications and libraries and likes to point out all the cool things you actually can do with anonymous networks. He originated one SAM library and maintains two others, and tries to participate in pretty much all of them. idk also likes to make sure I2P noobs get the help they need on Reddit and blogs about I2P application development.</p>
<p>I2P is a 17-year-old Open-Source project dedicated to enabling privacy and anonymity using advanced cryptography. It enables client-server applications, hidden services, and peer-to-peer applications to work anonymously and provides API's orientated toward application development in addition to browsing.</p>
<h2 id="materials-provided">Materials provided</h2>
<p>Each participant will be provided with a detailed handout which will provide a schedule of the workshop with references to additional resources relevant to each section. The full source code of the Lua library that will be developed will be publshed prior to Def Con to be used as a resource during the workshop. Practical activities will be distributed during the workshop to the participants to demonstrate the techniques that will be illustrated.</p>
<h2 id="audiovisualcomputer-requirements">Audio/Visual/Computer Requirements</h2>
<p>Participants are welcome, but not required, to follow along with the examples and practicum provided during the workshop. In order to do so, they will need a laptop with internet access and their choice of Lua interpreter installed. They should also have I2P routers installed, either I2P or i2pd will do, but if they do not wish to install a router, I will bring a machine which will expose the API's they need for testing purposes they can use while they are here. I will also need a way to display examples to the workshop participants, either a projector or a large television would be best.</p>
