<h2 id="i2cp"><a href="https://geti2p.net/en/docs/protocol/i2cp">I2CP</a></h2>
<p>I2CP is the core I2P API, it underlies many of the other I2P API's. It is also the most complex to use outside of Java, but recently several libraries have emerged that provide partial or full I2CP functionality from other languages. C, Java, and Javascript libraries are available, as is one Go library with partial support.</p>

<h2 id="i2ptunnel"><a href="https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/i2ptunnel">I2PTunnel</a></h2>
<p>Java applications can also embed their own instances of I2PTunnel in order to use it to set up I2P tunnels. However, even non-java applications can take advantage of drop-in configuration of I2Ptunnel via i2ptunnel.config.d in the Java i2p router, or tunnels.conf.d in the C++ i2P router. In this way, regular clear-web applications can provide alternate configurations that automatically configure their I2P tunnels. If you ship i2ptunnel.config.d files, then any application can be turned into an I2P application without necessarily requiring any modification to the application's code.</p>

<h2 id="i2pcontrol"><a href="https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/i2pcontrol">I2PControl</a></h2>
<p>I2PControl is a little different. Rather than setting up connections between I2P applications, it's used for configuring and retrieving information about the router programmatically.</p>

<h2 id="sam-version-3"><a href="https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/samv3">SAM Version 3</a></h2>
<p>The current recommended API for applications of all types to communicate via I2P is the SAMv3 API. It provides a convenient way to set up, communicate through, and tear down I2P connections. It is designed so that it can implement the API familiar to your programming language in a simple and straightforward way. For example, we can implement a Socket in Java or a net.Conn in Go.</p>
<p>SAM will by and large be the focus of this workshop.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/samv3" class="uri">https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/samv3</a></li>
</ul>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h2 id="which-api-do-you-need">Which API do You Need?</h2>
<p>If you need to make connections between applications automatically, then you need the <strong>SAMv3 API</strong>.</p>
<p>If you need to monitor or adjust the I2P router's connection, bandwidth usage, or change it's status, then you need the <strong>I2PControl API</strong>.</p>
<p>If you need to set up tunnels for an already-existing Web Application, then I2Ptunnel, either by embedding it in your application or by placing files into i2ptunnel.config.d.</p>
<p>If you need to simply check the presence of an I2P router before making connections, one way is to make a quick connection to the <strong>I2CP API</strong>. If you're writing a Java application, the I2CP API may also be a good choice. Besides that, unless you know why you need to use I2CP, you probably just need SAM.</p>

<h3 id="but-why-not-just-tell-users-to-set-up-i2ptunnel-via-the-existing-webui">But Why Not Just Tell Users to Set Up I2PTunnel via the existing WebUI?</h3>
<p>I2Ptunnel is good at forwarding existing services to I2P, and it can concievably be used for many applications. It does provide a SOCKS proxy after all. However, setting up i2ptunnels is an involved process, with lots of settings that are intimidating to your users. Using SAM, you set up the connections and apply all the options inside the application itself, <strong>giving you the all-important</strong> <strong>oppourtunity to set up sane defaults</strong> on behalf of your users.</p>
<p>A good example can be found in applications that are federated with Activitypub. While I2Ptunnel is perfectly capable of making AP applications available over I2P, not many new users will correctly configure the AP-based service correctly on their first try. The process of setting up connections, deciding whether or not to &quot;Bridge&quot; clearnet connections or remain strictly anonymous, deciding tunnel length and the number of tunnels in your destination &quot;Pool,&quot; and most other I2P connection-related functions.</p>

<p>Are you primarily:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing information or recieving it?</li>
<li>Do you need ordered, Streaming-style communications</li>
<li>Do you need unordered or semi-reliable Datagram-style communication</li>
<li>Do you do peer discovery? How do you do peer discovery?</li>
<li>When you do peer discovery, do you need to trust a service?</li>
<li>Do you need to bootstrap off of a DHT?</li>
<li>Do you want clients to be able to boostrap off of eachother?</li>
<li>Do you want to also connect to clearnet clients?</li>
<li>Do you need to be anonymous in mixed clearnet/I2P mode?</li>
<li>Do you need to send datagrams in mixed clearnet/I2P mode?</li>
<li>Do you want to allow people to bridge anonymous and non-anonymous clients?</li>
</ul>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h2 id="what-is-sam">What is SAM</h2>
<p>SAM is a simple API for controlling <strong>connections</strong> on the I2P i2p router in a way which is familiar to people who write internet applications. To use it, you simply set up a SAM connection and then use it like a streaming connection or to send datagrams, either with or without a repliable address. You can use these connections just like their TCP/IP equivalents for basically every intent or purpose.</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h3 id="stages-of-the-sam-setup-process">Stages of the SAM Setup process</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Handshake</li>
<li>Session Establishment</li>
<li>Communication</li>
</ol>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h3 id="handshake">Handshake</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is done so that you can negotiate the features of your SAM client with the SAM service.</li>
<li>First, establish a socket connection to the I2P router's SAM Port.</li>
<li>From the client, it's a simple &quot;HELLO&quot; message which can contain optional version and authentication information.</li>
<li>When the server replies, it will respond with OK and the maximum supported SAM version.</li>
</ul>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h3 id="connectionsmessaging">Connections/Messaging</h3>
<ul>
<li>Now that you've established a session, you can start making connections and/or sending messages.</li>
<li>Streaming connections are bi-directional, and can either be connected as a client to a server or listened upon to accept connections as a server to a client. Predictably, the commands you send to the SAM bridge to set up each kind of connection is &quot;STREAM CONNECT&quot; for connections and &quot;STREAM ACCEPT&quot; for listeners.</li>
<li>Datagrams can be sent after a datagram style session has been established by sending datagrams to the socket. They can be repliable and include a return address or raw and not include a return address.</li>
<li>Once you have created a Streaming connection, any further communication on that socket will be done with I2P, whether it be an HTTP Client, a connection between bittorrent peers, or any other kind of Streaming communication.</li>
</ul>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h3 id="connectionsmessaging-1">Connections/Messaging</h3>
<ul>
<li>Now that you've established a session, you can start making connections and/or sending messages.</li>
<li>Streaming connections are bi-directional, and can either be connected as a client to a server or listened upon to accept connections as a server to a client.

</ul>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h3 id="make-your-code-re-usable">Make your Code Re-Usable!</h3>
<p>Because of the deliberate similarity to existing streaming and datagram communications, every language makes it possible to reduce this process to one or two steps at sensible layers of abstraction. Starting from the most similar, like a Socket in Java, a connection in Javascript, or a net.Conn in Go. The actual thing will vary from language to language, but when creating a library, you should probably start with a whatever's closest to a Socket.</p>
<p>Once you've done that, you've laid the foundation to alter the other network parts of your language. In many cases, it may be possible to forward a connection using the code you've already written, or to replace an underlying structure with your SAM-enabled version.</p>
<p>In a surprisingly short amount of time, you too can develop extensive tooling that makes building new I2P applications and, more importantly, adapting your existing applications to use I2P simple, reliable, and familiar.</p>
<p>Or you can literally just write your own i2ptunnel that you can embed in your existing application. I did that once. It works really well. I don't think we need a gazillion 'socat for I2P' out there but some would argue we didn't need a third so who am I to judge.</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h2 id="bundling-an-i2p-router-with-your-sam-application">Bundling an I2P Router with your SAM Application</h2>
<p>Sometimes, the details of setting up your SAM application require you to know whether an I2P router is present and ready to accept SAM connections or not. As of release 0.9.42 in a few weeks, this becomes a very easy problem to solve. Let's take a slightly complicated case as an example, a non-JVM, non-plugin application for Windows.</p>
<p>Since there's a good chance your SAM Application is in a non-Java, non-JVM language, it may be difficult or impossible to build as a plugin for the I2P router. If that's the case, then we can't <em>assume</em> a router is there.</p>
<p>Since this is a Windows machine, we can't <em>assume</em> that a package manager is available with a viable I2P router to install. If that's the case, we'll have to install our own.</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h3 id="kicking-off-a-child-installer-with-nsis">Kicking off a child installer with NSIS</h3>
<p>One common way of creating a Windows installer for an application is to use Nullsoft Scriptable Install System. NSIS has the ability to do two essential things. First, it can check for the existence of the file, and second, it can start a new Windows application, and that application can be the I2P installer package.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode NSIS"><code>Section &quot;GetI2P&quot;
  SetOutPath $INSTDIR
    IfFileExists &quot;$PROGRAMFILES\i2p\i2p.exe&quot; endGetI2P beginGetI2P
    Goto endGetI2P
  beginGetI2P:
    MessageBox MB_YESNO &quot;Your system does not appear to have i2p installed.$\n$\nDo you wish to install it now?&quot;
    File &quot;i2pinstaller.exe&quot;
    ExecWait &quot;$INSTDIR\i2pinstaller.exe&quot;
    SetOutPath &quot;$PROGRAMFILES\i2p&quot;
    File &quot;clients.config&quot;
    SetOutPath &quot;C:\\ProgramData\i2p&quot;
    File &quot;clients.config&quot;
    SetOutPath &quot;$AppData\I2P&quot;
    File &quot;clients.config&quot;
  endGetI2P:
SectionEnd</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, after the i2pinstaller.exe is done running, a clients.config file is copied to the I2P application data directory. We can <strong>ONLY</strong> do it in this case because we already determines that I2P was not installed, and it is <strong>ONLY</strong> in this example in this way because 0.9.42 isn't out yet.</p>

<h3 id="wait-how-can-i-make-sure-the-router-i-am-bundling-is-current">Wait, how can I make sure the router I am bundling is current?</h3>

    wget -c `cat geti2p.url` -O i2pinstaller.exe

<h3 id="wait-what-if-i-dont-want-to-make-my-clients-install-a-jvm">Wait, what if I don't want to make my clients install a JVM?</h3>
<p>Two projects at least have been working on using the 'Jlink' tool to produce an I2P router that does not require the use of a JVM, those include i2p-zero from the Monero project and the Zero-Dependency installer from the I2P project. These may be preferable choices if you are bundling a router to use with a non-java application and are averse to requiring your users to install a JVM.</p>

<h3 id="wait-how-to-i-finally-make-sure-that-it-has-the-sam-api-enabled">Wait, how to I finally make sure that it has the SAM API enabled?</h3>
<p>Now that we're sure an I2P router is installed, we need to make sure that a SAM API is available to your application to use. Since 0.9.42, all platforms that use SAM can also use clients.config.d. That way, you can drop a file in to an I2P router you have just installed or one that exists on the computer already, without needing to worry about over-writing or otherwise harmfully altering a potentially sensitive configuation file.</p>
