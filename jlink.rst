Wait, what if I don't want to make my clients install a JVM?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two projects at least have been working on using the 'Jlink' tool to produce
an I2P router that does not require the use of a JVM, those include i2p-zero
from the Monero project and the Zero-Dependency installer from the I2P project.
These may be preferable choices if you are bundling a router to use with a
non-java application and are averse to requiring your users to install a JVM.
