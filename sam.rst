`SAM Version 3 <https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/samv3>`__
--------------------------------------------------------

The current recommended API for applications of all types to communicate via I2P
is the SAMv3 API. It provides a convenient way to set up, communicate through,
and tear down I2P connections. It is designed so that it can implement the API
familiar to your programming language in a simple and straightforward way. For
example, we can implement a Socket in Java or a net.Conn in Go.

SAM will by and large be the focus of this workshop.
